# Utilities

This is a set of useful bash utilities that I have curated over the years.

## How to Use

In order to use `utils.sh` you must `checkout` the branch for your operating-system.

`Utilities` supports:

- `linux`-based operating-systems via the `linux` branch.
- `unix`-based operating-systems via the `macos` branch.
